This is an example Ant+Ivy+TestNG project.

Why?
====

Because I couldn't find an easy, well put together example. This project is good to go, so long as you have ant and ivy installed.

Why Ant at all?
===============

Maven is great for package management, but if you've ever used it, you know its a bundle of suck to configure or use. You cannot:

- Create custom tasks
- Do basic file system operations
- Setup different compile paths

Without installing lots of extra plugins, which take valuable time to configure. Maven was supposed to be a configure-free tool, an ideal as lofty as it is impractical. Its better to use:

- Convention over Configuration
- Programmability wherever possible.

Adding Ivy into the mix allows you to get all of the benefits of maven (minus plugins) with none of the sucky parts. TestNG gives you a modern, flexible testing framework, which can run the old JUnit test as well, for those stuck in their ways.

Why not Groovy/Gradle?
======================

I'm not opposed to either, however, Ant is a Java tool, Groovy and Gradle, although they are Java compatible, are not Java tools. Furthermore:

* You may need Ant for an old project
* You may not know/want to learn Gradle or Groovy.
* My philsophy is its better to stick to a tool that's closer to the task, Ant for Java, Make for C/C++, Grunt for JS, etc.
* I needed to setup a project like this, but didn't know how - hopefully this helps someone else.
